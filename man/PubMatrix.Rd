\title{Query PubMed or PMC and Build a Pairwise Co-occurrence Matrix}
\usage{
PubMatrix(
  file = NULL,
  A = NULL,
  B = NULL,
  API.key = NULL,
  Database = "pubmed",
  daterange = NULL,
  outfile = NULL,
  export_format = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Optional path to a text file containing search terms. The file
must contain a `#` separator line between the `A` and `B` term lists. Used
only when `A` and `B` are both `NULL`.}

\item{A}{Character vector of search terms for matrix columns.}

\item{B}{Character vector of search terms for matrix rows.}

\item{API.key}{Optional NCBI API key.}

\item{Database}{Character scalar. One of `"pubmed"` or `"pmc"`.}

\item{daterange}{Optional numeric vector of length 2 giving
`c(start_year, end_year)`.}

\item{outfile}{Optional output file stem used when `export_format` is set.}

\item{export_format}{Optional export format: `"csv"` or `"ods"`.}
}
\value{
A data frame of publication counts with rows named by `B` and columns
  named by `A`.
}
\description{
`PubMatrix()` counts publications for all pairwise combinations of two term
sets using the NCBI Entrez E-utilities API. It returns a matrix-like data
frame with rows corresponding to terms in `B` and columns corresponding to
terms in `A`.

\details{
Examples and vignettes should avoid live web queries during package
checks. This function performs live requests to NCBI and may fail when there
is no internet connectivity or when the service is unavailable.

\examples{
# Construct terms locally (live query example kept commented for checks)
A <- c("WNT1", "WNT2")
B <- c("FZD1", "FZD2")
# result <- PubMatrix(A = A, B = B, Database = "pubmed", daterange = c(2020, 2023))
# print(result)
message("Live query example is commented out to avoid web access during checks.")

# Input validation examples (offline-safe)
try(PubMatrix(A = NULL, B = NULL, file = NULL))
try(PubMatrix(A = "a", B = "b", Database = "invalid_db"))
